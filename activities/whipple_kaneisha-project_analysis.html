		<h1>Project Analysis for Blessed Thoughts Greeting Cards</h1>
		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<p>The intent of this project is to redesign the website Blessed Thoughts Greeting Cards. I will be completely changing the site so it will have the proper HTML5 and CSS markup because after checking the site’s validation there were some errors. Most importantly I will be redesigning the site so it will be more user friendly and visually appealing so the site can get some traffic. </p>
			<p>The site doesn’t have much for its intended to audience to know what it is about or even a way for the client to know what it’s customers will want in a card so other having a home page it is important to create a new order form for the site.</p>

			<p>The site doesn’t have too much content however the content it does have is clustered and makes it hard to read. This is where the CSS will come in handy to add style and structure to the site.</p>
		
		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
			<p>Since my client is trying to not just stay in a local area it has stiff competition. So far its biggest competitors are Blue Mountain, American Greetings, and Jacquie Lawson.
When typing in greeting cards into Alexa they were the top sites. Their rankings went:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://www.jacquielawson.com/">Jacquielawson.com</a> Rank: 2,342</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.bluemountain.com/">Bluemountain.com</a> Rank: 6,241</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.americangreetings.com/">Americangreetings.com</a> Rank: 6,683</li>
				</ul>
			<p>So far Blessed Thoughts doesn’t even pop up on Alexa. Since it would be using the same keywords as its competitors I looked their words up on Google AdWords. Those words were:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Birthday Greetings</li>
					<li>Birthday Cards</li>
					<li>Valentines Day</li>
					<li>Cards Print</li>
					<li>Anniversary</li>
					<li>Cards Wedding</li>
					<li>Greeting Cards</li>
				</ul>
			<p>While researching its competitors on Alexa we found:

Each sites viewer spends on an average 6 to 7 minutes on the site. Their audience is mostly females aged from the age 45 and up with the audience mostly viewing from home. After viewing the sites I saw that all of them were well organized and they even separated their cards by events and holidays.</p>

		<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
			<p>After much research I found I will be targeting mostly females ranging from ages 45 and up. Below are two user personas.</p>
			
			<h3>Sarah Jones</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Age: 47</li>
					<li>Children: 2</li>
					<li>College Graduate: Yes</li>
					<li>Occupation: Executive at a law firm</li>
					<li>Tech Familiarity: Middle</li>
					<li>Tech Usage: Daily</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p>Sarah works at a law firm so she needs a site that she can go to and quickly order a nice greeting card that she likes and is personalized just the way she likes.</p>

			<p>Her website workflow includes going to the website, looking up sample cards in the gallery, choosing one she likes, and ordering it.</p>
			
			<h3>Mildred Smith</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Age: 65</li>
					<li>Children: 3</li>
					<li>College Graduate: Yes</li>
					<li>Occupation: Retired</li>
					<li>Tech Familiarity: None</li>
					<li>Tech Usage: Rarely</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p>Mildred is a retired teacher who often spends her time babysitting her grandchildren. She’s not familiar with technology so she needs to be able to find her way around the site in the easiest manner possible.</p>

			<p>Her website workflow includes going to the website, reading the content, clicking through the site spending a large amount of time on the gallery and carefully planning the way she wants her card to look like, along with what it should say before finally placing the order.</p>
